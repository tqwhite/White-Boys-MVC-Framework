I am tired of frameworks that try to do everything in the world for me. I spend too much time trying to figure out others want to do things. From now on, I am doing it my way (until someone comes up with something better!).This framework does very, very little. It consists mainly of the .htaccess and class autoload plumbing to wire together the M, V and C. There is a decent, object-oriented view rendering method that pays special attention to supporting javascript and CSS. The main thing about Javascript is that the framework provides a way to include javascript files.This solves the problem I have had with having linked Javascript libraries in servable terrain. There are two problems with this. First, it's not associated with the app that it facilitates. To reduce the number of http accesses, you want to combine things into files and so you have a mess. It's also hard to locate the code that needs attention when it's all the way over in the server directory. One could include the JS in the view, but then you get bad code coloring and long, complex view files.This way, you get all the benefits of dividing your JS into tidy, little code files that color correctly and are easy to understand and, since the files are stuffed into the HTML stream, there are no wasteful HTTP calls. So far, I'm very happy with this solution.The same goes for CSS. You get namespaced, as it were, CSS. Only the files you consider appropriate to the one, particular page is included.Of course, it's possible to need global JS and CSS. There are view object utilities to generate normal script and style tags that reference the appropriate directories in the server space.If you have questions or suggestions, I want to hear them.
